These programs function in the following ways:
1) The first program takes input from the user and checks whether the number is divisible by 2 and gives the remainder 0. If so, then it's an even number or else it's an odd number.
2) The second program follows a very simple logic to print the sum of values till 50. So, I made the loop to iterate 50 times by putting the end value as (51), because we all know python only iterates a value less than the end value.
